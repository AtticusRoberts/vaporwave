# Sound/Music Visulizer
I made a sound/music visulizer in processing. 
I used the library minim, which lets me collect sound data from my mic and import it into my code.
I generated the terain by creating a bunch of triangle strips and manipulating the Z axies of the triangels with perlin noise, which is a sudo-random number generation algorithm that creates numbers in such a way that they are random, but related, and come together to form really dank patterns that end up looking almost natural.
The starts read the level of bass, and grow or shrink accordingly.
